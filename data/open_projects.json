The Forecast saves those susceptible to red tide impacts, prevents visits to their doctors and emergency rooms, and supports businesses that can lose thousands of dollars during red tides because visitors haven't been able to make informed decisions about whether or not going to the beach is safe. The citizen scientists use HABscope, a portable microscope system that utilizes video and artificial intelligence (AI) to quickly analyze water samples for near real-time cell counts of Karenia brevis, the organism that causes red tides in the Gulf of Mexico. These samples are combined with other environmental data and the result is the Red Tide Respiratory Forecast."

        "Accurate air quality measurements are the foundation of regulatory programs that reduce air pollution. Recent improvements in sensor technology allow volunteer citizens scientists to measure air pollution in their communities. However, a challenge is that the quality of data obtained from low-cost air sensors often is not equal to more expensive monitors used by government agencies. A cost-effective way to assess the performance of low-cost air sensors (and create data correction equations that make sensor data comparable to government monitors) is to test low-cost sensors near the more expensive technology at regulatory monitoring sites. This project sets up small testing enclosures that will be set up at regulatory air monitoring sites. It will fund construction of air sensor shelters, to be set up on or near tribal lands, that can be used by tribal, state and local air monitoring agencies. Tribal environmental agencies and citizen science organizations can use these air sensor testing shelters to conduct air sensor projects. Placement of collocated testing shelters at existing regulatory air monitoring sites allows for direct data comparisons between low- cost sensors and more expensive monitoring technology - a recommended method in EPA guidance for assessing air sensor measurement accuracy and uncertainty."

Unfortunately, the automated observing systems cannot discriminate between some of the more important types. Thus, human observers are needed. Yet, to deploy dedicated human observers is impractical because the knowledge needed to identify the various precipitation types is common among the public. To most efficiently gather such observations requires the public to be engaged as citizen scientists using a very simple, convenient, nonintrusive method. To achieve this an application program inteface (API) that can be contained in a simple 'app' was developed. This API is the citizen science tool that makes  the Meteorological Phenomena Identification Near the Ground (mPING) possible. The apps using the mPING API run on 'smart' phones or, more generically, web-enabled devices with GPS location capabilities. Using mPING, anyone with a smartphone can pass observations to researchers and National Wether Servince peronnel at no additional cost to their phone service or to the research project. Deployed in mid-December 2012, mPING has proven to be not only very popular, but also capable of providing consistent, accurate observational data."

Faculty from Cal Poly and Moss Landing Marine Labs developed a scientifically rigorous hook-and-line survey in partnership with the NOAA Fisheries Southwest Fisheries Science Center and the recreational fishing industry (the Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel, or CPFV, fishing fleet), where vessels (including vessel Captain and crew) are chartered to conduct the survey, and volunteers conduct all of the sampling. During a sampling event, volunteer anglers are assigned a station aboard the fishing vessel to fish, while scientific staff collect information on the environmental conditions, the catch by species, size of each fish, and tag a subset of fish. The vast majority of fishes caught (with some exceptions for age data collections or other special studies) are released with descending devices to increase post-capture survivorship. In 2016, CCFRP was expanded statewide to include six partner academic institutions, monitoring 14 protected areas and 14 adjacent reference sites spanning the entire coast of California. Over 1,650 volunteer anglers have caught more than 150,000 fish since 2007.  The volunteers include all experience levels of anglers and ages from high school students to retirees. As one of the few citizen science programs contributing data to stock assessments and protected area management, the program inherently supports the sustainable management of domestic fisheries, and provides high-quality data to address a range of other management questions. In addition, the collaborative nature of the methodology allows the fishing community to work directly with scientists, increasing trust and confidence in the resulting data from both groups."

For example, the incidence of dengue, a vector-borne disease affecting approximately 100 million people per year, can increase 3-5 fold during an epidemic, yet no clear indicator of the intensity or timing of an epidemic exists until it is already underway. Influenza and other globally important diseases present similar challenges. Advances in forecasting for these diseases and others are continually occurring, yet research gaps limit forecasting model development, evaluation of forecasts, and adoption by decision-makers. The Epidemic Prediction Initiative (EPI) aims to improve the science and usability of forecasts by addressing these challenges. Since January 2016, EPI has published influenza forecasts from participating teams in real-time on the EPI website. This was the first time that infectious disease forecasts from multiple groups were published jointly in real-time, facilitating forecast comparison and evaluation by public health officials. EPI also initiated and maintains an open online repository of code and data related to epidemics. This activity aims to reduce redundancy in data cleaning, standardize data formats, and support forecasting research. Finally, EPI has been engaging in outreach efforts within CDC, among other federal government agencies, with state and international public health officials, and in the academic community to better understand how to improve forecast accuracy and how forecasts can be used in public health decision making. The collaborative approach of EPI is the basis for COVID-19 forecasting in the U.S., the largest scale real-time epidemic forecasting initiative to date."

Traditionally, this was done manually however, recent efforts were made to automate this process. About 8 years ago, NIOSH developed an auto-coder that read a narrative and assigned it to the appropriate causation category. It was estimated that this auto-coder was about 82% accurate. This auto-coder relieved the manual burden of reading thousands of claims and was often more consistent in its designations.

To this end, ARS scientists and university collaborators have developed an adaptive grazing management experiment being implemented at the Central Plains Experimental Range in northeastern Colorado. A Stakeholder Group of 11 persons was selected to represent ranchers, public land managers, conservation organizations and nongovernmental organizations. This Stakeholder Group met in September of 2012 and January and September of 2013 to 1) choose and prioritize outcomes desired from this experiment, 2) determine criteria and/or triggers for movement of livestock among pastures in an adaptive manner, and 3) select appropriate monitoring data requirements needed for feedback to determine if management is achieving desired outcomes.

These photos can be vital to researchers across many fields, but many are inaccessible because they lack labels for common features like islands, volcanoes, and rivers. Feature Hunter is the first step toward the creation of a machine learning model aimed at labeling previously uncategorized Astronaut Photography with geographic features. Machine learning requires large sets of training data to produce accurate results. Feature Hunter users will help develop this training data by viewing images, determining whether or not a feature or features are present, and identifying features by placing bounding boxes around them. Then, experts in the Earth Science and Remote Sensing Unit will use this data to develop and deploy a machine learning model to add feature-level metadata to the entire astronaut photography database."

Additionally, typical radon testing technology (charcoal cannisters or electric-powered devices) are impractical because of high humidity and electrical power uncertainties in Puerto Rico. The 2017 hurricanes (Irma and Maria) that devastated the island present an opportunity to improve radon mitigation strategies during renovation and rebuilding. This project will deploy new radon measurement devices that rapidly show results via integrated electronic readings. The project will engage communities and neighborhoods in radon surveys. Radon measurements will be carried out by community members who will receive citizen-level training. Monitoring radon in neighborhoods will provide actionable information to citizens and inform local and regional policy.

A major source of bacterial contamination comes from aging, leaking water infrastructure or illegal connections of human sanitary sewers to municipal separate storm sewer systems. The stormwater toolbox equipment loan program supports volunteer water quality monitoring groups in their sampling efforts. Data on stormwater collected by these organizations complements data from EPA's monitoring programs. The framework behind it, the EPA New England Bacterial Source Tracking Protocol, is a method used to investigate human sources of bacterial contamination into stormwater systems and receiving waters. In addition to water quality monitoring equipment, the loan program provides a consistent and quality-assured protocol for collection of high quality data."

Through this partnership over 300 Indigenous citizens have been trained in water sample collection, which has resulted in over 1500 samples collected at more than 54 sites covering the entire 2,300 mile reach of the Yukon River since the program began. In addition to water-quality monitoring a permafrost monitoring project began in 2009 called the Active Layer Network. This project measures the thickness of the active layer on an annual basis and collects air and soil temperature readings as well as soil moisture measurements at 20 locations across the Yukon River Basin and Alaska and Canada.

The first steps in becoming an official NWS SKYWARN Weather Spotter is to complete training on weather hazards and their reporting in your area. Classroom type training is typically offered each Spring and Fall. To find the next available training provided by your local NWS forecast office please visit this interactive map: http://www.nws.noaa.gov/skywarn/skywarn.htm In partnership with the COMET\u00ae Program, which is part of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research's Community Programs supplemental national web-based training was also created.

The ashfall report database will help AVO track eruption clouds and associated fallout downwind. These reports from the public will also give scientists a more complete record of the amount and duration and other conditions of ash fall. First-hand accounts of ashfall will support ashfall model development and interpretation of satellite imagery and will improve ashfall warning messages. The online form will also free up resources during exceedingly busy times during an eruption, as most individuals currently phone AVO with their reports."

OCNMS volunteers originally initiated shoreline debris monitoring in 2001 using data categories standardized by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Ocean Conservancy.  Heightened interest in shoreline debris data associated with concerns about materials originating from the March 2011 Japan tsunami coincided with release of the new NOAA methods, which prompted significant modification of OCNMS\u2019 shoreline debris monitoring program.  Shoreline debris data will be used to document temporal, spatial, and composition patterns in debris deposition on Washington\u2019s coastline, and to the extent possible to identify changes in debris types and volumes associated with the March 2011 tsunami debris.  In 2012, new shoreline debris monitoring methods were initiated at 6 sites on the outer coast of Washington state.  By 2014 there were nine coast sites and seven sites on the Strait of Juan de Fuca.  The goal for FY 2015 is to continue this monitoring effort and expand the effort to teachers and their students within walking distance of coast sites."

        "Balancing sustainable ecological and economic objectives is a continuing challenge for fisheries managers. Many US fisheries harvest healthy target stocks, however, bycatch of non-target species is common, and can result in large-scale fishery closures. Technological advancements in remote sensing over the past decade have revolutionized the way fishermen target ocean resources and the amount of data available on the ocean environment. In partnership with the California drift gillnet fishery and National Marine Fisheries Service, we aim to use these data to balance protection of ecological resources and economic viability. The objective of this Feasibility Study Project is to evaluate the applicability of EcoCatch, a near real-time, multi-species fisheries management tool. Our approach will build on previous NASA-funded projects, TurtleWatch and WhaleWatch, that couple spatial data of protected species with remotely-sensed data to successfully reduce bycatch and other human impacts. We will use remotely sensed satellite oceanographic, fisheries and satellite tracking data to produce near-real time spatial models of target catch and bycatch, assimilating additional information from fishermen input. Our objective is to develop a predictive tool that will enhance conservation of protected and non-target species, while maintaining sustainability and profitability of the fishery."

Highly reliable data on marine mammal strandings from domoic acid (DA) toxicosis are provided by the Marine Mammal Center (TMMC) and serve as an important source of matchups for broad geographic attribution of the DA events. These near real-time validation data are provided by our collaboration with the JellyWatch and TempBreak communities to populate crowdsourced observations with marine mammal stranding data that serve as a proxy for offshore DA events.

        "The Coastal observation And Seabird Survey Team (COASST) is a citizen-science program established to identify the carcasses of marine birds found on beaches along the coast of the Pacific Northwest. COASST is a project of the University of Washington in partnership with state, tribal and federal agencies, environmental organizations, and community groups along the coasts of Oregon, Washington and Alaska.  COASST believes citizens of coastal communities are essential scientific partners in monitoring marine ecosystem health.  By collaborating with citizens, natural resource management agencies and environmental organizations, COASST works to translate long-term monitoring into effective marine conservation solutions.Specifically, trained COASST volunteers conduct surveys for beached birds on the same stretch of coastline each month.  Each bird carcass is measured, identified, photographed, marked, and left in place for potential re-find on subsequent surveys.  Beach morphology, visitors use and presence or absence oil is also recorded. COASST data have created a baseline, or the 'normal' pattern, for beached bird mortality. Armed with this information, we can detect unusual events such as increased mortality due to low food availability, weather, harmful algal blooms, oil spills, or other factors. Perhaps most importantly, COASST data can be used to identify long-term changes in the status of our resident marine bird populations."

        "Global pollinator populations are in decline for a variety of reasons including habitat loss, pesticide use, and climate change. The Greater Atlanta Pollinator Partnership (GAPP) was initiated in 2011 because of the rapid loss of habitat and increase in pesticide use caused by the housing boom of the 1990s and early 2000s. Over this 20-year period, approximately 400,000 acres of green space were lost.  Goals of the GAPP are to encourage restoration and development of pollinator habitat at a landscape scale that is ecologically significant; consequently, we designed our project to focus on an area within a 25 - mile radius around downtown Atlanta, Georgia. This comprises nearly 1.2 million acres of potential pollinator habitat and includes all major public lands in metropolitan Atlanta and thousands of individual residences. Within this area, efforts focus on restoring pollinator-friendly habitat and educating the public through formal and informal opportunities.  Key components of the GAPP include using native species when available, rescuing native plants from construction sites, controlling invasive species, establishing community gardens, citizen science projects, conservation, education, research, and website development.  The GAPP website (http://gapp.org/) is critical to our online garden registration and mapping so we can track garden establishment, assess habitat development trends including identifying where corridors are developing or where more effort is needed, provide online educational materials, and provide focus to the effort through a newsletter. Through the GAPP, Bombus pensylvanicus, a rare and declining species, has been documented in a community garden in downtown Atlanta.  This indicates even rare species can be conserved in urban environments if the appropriate species are planted.  Funding for the Greater Atlanta Pollinator Partnership is limited, so synergy through partnerships is the key to success."

        "Gros Ventre Project - A Cooperative Project with the U.S. Forest Service & Nature Mapping In January 2009, the Bridger-Teton National Forest issued a new travel and use plan that affected road use throughout the forest including in the Gros Ventre drainage. Forest Service staff did not have the resources needed to adequately cover the monitoring needs therefore creating an ideal situation where volunteer citizen scientists could assist to collect critical information that will inform decisions and engage people in a timely and meaningful wildlife project. The spring of 2011 represented the second year of this data collection effort. The project is expected to continue through 2012 or 2015 (3-5 years total). Project Background The Gros Ventre drainage is critically important for many wildlife species and was a primary focus during the motor vehicle planning process. The new motor vehicle designations made some significant changes in this drainage to reduce impacts on wildlife, reduce maintenance costs and improve the ability to enforce travel regulations.  One change was a new seasonal restriction prohibited public motor vehicle use until June 1st in the upper portion of the drainage beyond the Slate/Crystal Creek junction. This change was primarily intended to protect the native soil road surface in the upper portion of the drainage thereby reducing road maintenance costs and to benefit wildlife during the transition from winter to summer range. Existing data shows that the drainage is important for elk calving, pronghorn antelope migration, bighorn sheep, as well as sage grouse leks. The USFS and Nature Mapping wanted to establish a baseline and gain more knowledge about how animals were distributed in the drainage during the critical spring transition from wintering to summering grounds. Gathering this information consistently each year provides critical information on the efficacy of the seasonal restriction."

Through the Regional Sustainable Environmental Science (RESES) research program, EPA Region 10 is partnering with communities across the Pacific Northwest to address this reality. This project introduces academic institutions, community based organizations and state and local government to the EPA\u2019s Community Focused Exposure and Risk Screening Tool. C-FERST is a web based, environmental information and GIS mapping tool that acts as a resource for communities to identify, understand and assess potential risk and exposure at the local level. By beta testing C-FERST in community based participatory research projects, community members take on the role of scientists; conducting community assessments, developing data collection mechanisms for field research and ground truthing to link remote data with local knowledge. Community and agency data are incorporated through simple, user generated GIS layers, photographs and \u2018map notes\u2019 on C-FERST. The project is modeled using academic institutions as a hub to engage underserved communities including youth of color, houseless populations and school-age children. Their environmental concerns range from brownfields and community livability and children\u2019s health and asthma along the I-5 corridor in Portland, OR to urban environmental education and just and healthy food systems in Tacoma, WA. This research is supported by the EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD) Sustainable and Healthy Communities (SHC) program."

When the public is unaware of how to contact their local Stranding Network, response can be delayed, compromising the animal\u2019s chance of survival and/or limiting the amount of valuable data collected from dead animals. By providing valuable information on smartphones, including a colorful species identification guide, the public will know who to call and what to do when they find a sick, injured or dead marine mammal, thus contributing to marine mammal conservation."

Observations made locally are submitted to the GLOBE data and information system, and can be accessed freely online. These measurements are combined with readings at automated stations to create a worldwide resource for conducting scientific inquiry; some measurements serve as ground truth for NASA satellite data products (e.g., clouds, soil moisture).  The GLOBE data and information system contains over 145 million measurements from more than 10 million students in 119 countries around the world since its operation begun in 1995.

Today the program has nearly 10,000 volunteers that contribute to daily measurements in a variety of locales, from urban to rural and ocean-to-ocean across the nation. The NWS supports Coop through the selection of observation locations, the recruitment and training of observers, the installation of equipment, as well as maintenance, collection and disbursement of data with the help of the National Climate Data Center. Funding for Coop began after the establishment of the Weather Bureau by Congress in 1890, therefore establishing the first network of cooperative weather stations.  Since then, volunteer weather observation has been the backbone of the United States climate data, crediting the Cooperative Network for establishing the most definitive source of weather data for the United States."

The Weed Blitz is an all-day event where volunteers attend a training presentation in the morning from Glacier National Park\u2019s Invasive Plant Management Program, and in the afternoon, volunteers separate into groups to search for and pull invasive plants.  Once trained, Citizen Scientists conduct surveys along Glacier National Park\u2019s 700+ miles of hiking trails from June to September to determine the distribution and extent of the five targeted invasive species within the park. Species targeted by the program are Spotted Knapweed (Centaurea stoebe), Oxeye Daisy (Leucanthemum vulgare), Houndstongue, (Cynoglossum officinale), St. Johnswort (Hypericum perforatum) and Yellow Toadflax (Linaria vulgaris). The Invasive Plant Citizen Science Project provides valuable data to the Invasive Plant Management Program in Glacier National Park.

Common Loons are a Montana Species of Special Concern, and Glacier National Park harbors about 20 percent of Montana\u2019s breeding pairs. Loons are susceptible to adverse impacts by human disturbance at nest and nursery sites. The Common Loon Citizen Science Project helps to identify factors that affect nesting success.

Providing a database of these case studies with each case study broken down into queriable properties makes this information even more powerful in planning future exploration efforts in new areas. The goal of this effort is to develop a template for geothermal case studies in a crowd-sourced platform to allow for contributions from the entire geothermal community. Information collected for the case studies includes historical information regarding exploration and development in an area and current information about reservoir characteristics and facility production. The initial focus is on populating case studies for developing and operational geothermal areas throughout the world that can then be used as a basis for discovering new areas, and guiding efficient exploration and development of those areas."

Our goals are threefold: to systematically collect baseline data on seabirds within sanctuary boundaries to compare populations over time; to educate the public about seabirds and connect residents with their sanctuary; and to train a group of observers to join our scientists in this groundbreaking project.  The resulting data will be used to compare relative abundance of seabirds over time--to help us understand populations within the sanctuary and their possible impacts on local ecosystems and as a barometer for other changes in the environment. Staff and volunteers of Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary conduct an annual National Audubon Christmas Bird Count (CBC) with Mass Audubon each year, following a scientific protocol to track bird populations and behavior for a day. However, in order to truly understand these birds, we need to track them more often at home at sea.  Mass Audubon has advised that, in addition to the CBC, we move toward at least five cruises per year on the Auk, plus regular trips on vessels of opportunity.  Our valued volunteers can help us achieve this goal and help us communicate the status and importance of seabirds to the public."

(DYSI) - Report a Landslide is a website developed by the USGS Landslide Hazards Program that asks anyone who saw a landslide anywhere in the country to report their observations. These observations will build a much larger and more complete database that will help scientists gain a clearer picture of how landslides affect the entire United States. Every year, landslides cost the nation 1 to 2 billion dollars in damage. Falling rocks, mud, and debris flows are one of the most common and sometimes deadly hazards faced by all U.S. citizens, yet there is still a lot we do not know about how and why they happen. Now, scientists at the USGS are asking the public to help them track landslides to better understand how to protect lives and property. "

Students participating in KIC-NET use science, technology, engineering, and math skills to solve real-world environmental challenges. Using monitoring tools and processes, students test local water quality to gather data. They are testing factors like dissolved oxygen, pH and phosphate levels, temperature, and turbidity. They then work with city engineers and STEM professionals to learn what their data indicates, how stormwater management works, and how human activity contributes to runoff. From this investigation, students assess the most pressing environmental issue affecting their community\u2019s resiliency, research that issue, and engineer and execute a sustainable plan."

The program is part of Dr. Beth Middleton's project to compare the role of purple loosestrife in its native and invasive habitats. Purple loosestrife is native to Eurasia but invaded northern North America after accidental introduction in the 1800s. This species may be reducing the value of infested wetlands for wildlife, although this claim is debated. The results of the study will help in efforts to control and predict the future spread of this species. Growing numbers of people are volunteering to help in Australia, Canada, Turkey, and the United States. The data measurements include documenting details about your site location, measuring the height and numbers of loosestrife, and making a few environmental observations."

Through the TED system, the U.S. Geological Survey\u2019s National Earthquake Information Center analyzes data from social networks to detect earthquakes within seconds of their occurrence. TED harvests real-time tweets through a continuous connection to Twitter. The system applies a query parameter to reduce the stream to tweets that contain the keyword earthquake in several languages. For each tweet filtered by keyword, TED archives the creation time and text, the Twitter user location, the Twitter tweet ID, and the time the tweet appeared in the TED database. Around the clock, TED also ingests seismically derived earthquake information from the USGS\u2019s near-real-time internal global earthquake stream. TED archives the earthquake time, region, magnitude and hypocenter (latitude, longitude and depth). It also records the source of the scientifically derived earthquake information. TED detects two to three earthquakes a day, on average. Especially in regions with few seismometers, TED reports often come in before traditional seismic networks detect an earthquake, giving seismologists early warning. TED sometimes detects earthquakes entirely missed by USGS\u2019s automatic processing system, thereby increasing the number of felt events known to the agency. In addition, the tweet text and attached images sometimes offer a rapid qualitative assessment of an earthquake\u2019s impact."

The survey consists of numerous routes in the eastern half of the U.S. and Canada, which are surveyed in the spring. Counts of singing male woodcock along the routes provide an index to woodcock abundance, and are used to estimate woodcock population trends for states, provinces, management regions, and the continent. The survey is the major source of information considered in the annual setting of woodcock hunting seasons. The Singing-ground survey, in its present form, began in 1968 and has continued once a year to present day. There are approximately 1,500 Singing-ground Survey routes randomly placed throughout the heart of the woodcock breeding range in Canada and the United States. These routes were placed across the landscape, covering all habitat types. It is one of three surveys used to monitor woodcock population status in North America and it provides managers with an index to the relative woodcock population size. The survey takes advantage of the conspicuous breeding call of male American woodcock that can best be described as a \u201cpeent.\u201d We are looking for volunteers to conduct routes in Ontario (https://www.birdscanada.org/bird-science/american-woodcock-survey) and Quebec, only.

This integrated project will quantify relationships of weed distribution and spread with land use, then use that information directly in educating agriculture stakeholders, natural resources managers, and other interested parties on potential human-induced opportunities for invasive species spread. The Invasive Plant Atlas of the MidSouth (IPAMS) will provide information on the Biology, distribution, and best management practices for forty weedy plant species. Outreach and extension activities include developing training programs for volunteers to identify and report invasive species using IPAMS, developing an efficient Early Detection and Rapid Response (EDRR) system for invasive plants, developing best management practices workshops, and developing an online mapping system. Research activities include conducting systematic regional vegetation surveys to assess the distribution of key invasive plants, developing models for predicting the occurrence of target species based on land use and cover, and evaluating the relative effectiveness of professional versus volunteer surveys."

SEANET was initiated by the Tufts Center for Conservation Medicine, in collaboration with the Lloyd Center for Environmental Studies in Massachusetts, during Autumn 2002. Since this time, the project has expanded to beaches throughout New England, New York and New Jersey and more recently, to the southeastern US, with beaches in South Carolina, Georgia and Florida. SEANET volunteers conduct year-round beached bird surveys in order to identify and record information about bird mortality along the east coast of the United States. Data collected by hundreds of SEANET volunteers are used to examine the spatial pattern of bird carcass deposition and how it varies across time. These surveys provide baseline information about bird mortality and can help to detect mass mortality events due to oil spills, algal toxins, and disease outbreaks. Marine birds can serve as indicators of ecosystem and human health; monitoring the threats they face and their mortality patterns can teach us about the health of the marine environment."

Droege's idea has lots of applications to the type of work that ecologists, foresters, land managers, and environmental citizen groups do and provides an easy (and actually information dense) way of tracking long-term changes using volunteers using the smart phone that many carry in their pocket. The concept is broad and is meant to be applicable to any location you would like to create uniform documentation of change over long or short periods of time without having to install a permanent camera."

        "Insect emergence is a fundamental process in streams and rivers, because it represents a key life stage for aquatic insects and provides an important prey resource for terrestrial (e.g., birds, bats, and lizards) and aquatic consumers (e.g., fish). Studying insect emergence can lead to fundamental insights about the life history of insects, for example by identifying the specific times of year when emergence occurs. The number of insects emerging from a river is a function of larval population abundance in a river, so quantifying insect emergence might also be a useful proxy for standard benthic monitoring of insects; benthic monitoring in Grand Canyon is extremely challenging because of swift currents, deep water, and daily hydropeaking. In 2012 we started collaborating with commercial river guides (http://www.gcrg.org/) and Grand Canyon Youth (http://www.gcyouth.org/) to quantify insect emergence throughout the 240 mile long segment of the Colorado River in Marble and Grand Canyon.  Each night in camp, guides put out a simple light trap to collect flying insects.  After one hour, the light was turned off, the sample poured into a collection bottle, and some notes were recorded in a field book. After the conclusion of the river trip, guides dropped off samples and field notes at our office and we processed the samples in the laboratory."

Anyone can navigate to a site, take pictures and answer questions posed by scientists about plants, animals, water, or geology.  The data is then uploaded to a project database where the scientist can access it.   The pilot project on huckleberries and their pollinators will begin in Glacier National Park summer of 2016.  One goal of this framework is to allow 'easy entry' for scientists into public data collection and outreach.  Scientists use a website to set up routes, including 1 or more sites with the location coordinates, hints and photos to help people find the location, the questions to ask and descriptions of how to answer the questions.  The initial version will work on iphones. Features of the app include the ability to work outside of cellular service. Funding and development of the app is a partnership between computer scientists at the Fort Collins Science Center, research ecologist, Dr. Tabitha Graves, and the Community for Data Integration.  "

In 1995, a team of scientists at the USGS Northern Prairie Wildlife Research Center (NPWRC) conceived and developed two sites: Butterflies of the U.S. and Moths of the U.S. The mission, in part, of Northern Prairie's Grassland Ecosystem Initiative was to work with others to assess the biotic resources of the Great Plains, to facilitate information sharing among agencies, organizations, and individuals, and to synthesize that information. The BAMONA project is based upon work previously supported by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) National Biological Information Infrastructure (NBII) Program from 2004-2011."

She created the project in response to home gardening concerns in the Dewey-Humboldt, AZ community over possible metal contamination from the neighboring Iron King Mine and Humboldt Smelter Superfund site. The overall objective of Gardenroots was to determine whether home garden vegetables grown in Dewey-Humboldt had elevated levels of arsenic. By building co-created public participation in a scientific research program, this project also looked to educate, build human capacity, and increase community networking in resource-related issues in the community."

Several teachers attended a day long training to learn the protocols for Stream Team monitoring.  Students from Hydaburg, Craig and Klawock participated in one of two field days where they collected data while working alongside researchers. This project helps students developing their math and science skills while learning about forest management, salmon habitat, and restoration efforts on the Tongass National Forest. In addition, four students were selected for internships. Interns worked long days with fisheries professionals to learn hands on fisheries sampling skills. They learned how to cross and work in swift streams, net and handle live juvenile fish, measure the length and weight of fish, take scale samples, record data, sleep and stay in a remote field camp, and work as members of a team. The interns were also offered a scholarship to attend classes for a fisheries technician certificate from University of Alaska Southeast."

One of the main goals of the project is to transform teachers and students into citizen scientists.  The Invasive Mosquito Project provides educational materials for teachers and students.  As part of data gathering, students collect mosquito eggs around their houses.  After a week, upon the presence of eggs, students bring the mosquito eggs to class and choose to raise \u00bc of the eggs to adults following the protocol and safety measures provided in the lesson plan. The remaining eggs are sent to USDA.  Classes have the opportunity to assess local, regional and national mosquito distribution data and to determine if there is an increased risk of particular pathogens in their community based on the presence of certain mosquito vector species.  In addition to the public education component, another goal of the IMP project is to monitor invasive mosquito species in the United States.  The project uses a new partnered approach to citizen science given each classroom is paired with mosquito and public health professionals that support the lesson plans and data gathering by, for instance, confirming the students\u2019 mosquito identifications."

The simple act of planting a garden can help unite neighborhoods in a common effort and inspire voluntary, locally-led solutions to challenges facing our country - from hunger to the environment. The majority of garden construction, maintenance, harvest, data gathering, information sharing, is done by volunteer students, teachers and master gardeners. They've built over 2000 gardens, volunteered 222,000 hours and harvested over 3.9 million pounds of produce donated to local food banks."

Every September, students from Golden Sierra, El Dorado, Oak Ridge and Union Mine, and Pioneer High Schools travel to Union Valley Reservoir for the WES conference.  Working with specialists and teachers, they spend four days collecting physical and biological data about the creeks.  Creeks are monitored annually as part of this service learning conference. This year, the Summit expanded to include the South Fork of Long Canyon, a stream affected by the King Fire one year ago.  New reaches were identified and data points established for this year and future years for continued monitoring of post-fire watershed conditions."

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) coordinates the Midwinter Bald Eagle Survey, in which several hundred individuals count eagles along standard, non-overlapping survey routes. Nationwide counts of eagles were coordinated by the National Wildlife Federation from 1979 until 1992, when the Bureau of Land Management's Raptor Research and Technical Assistance Center assumed responsibility for overseeing the count.  Responsibility for count coordination shifted to the National Biological Survey (1993-1996) and later to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Forest and Rangeland Ecosystem Science Center, Snake River Field Station.  In April 2007, the USGS established a partnership with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to maintain the long-term, national coordination of the survey, data analysis, and reporting. USACE will assume responsibility for coordinating the national survey, organizing the results, maintaining the long-term database, and jointly compiling, analyzing, and reporting survey data gathered with USGS following previously used methods (Steenhof et al. 2002) in 2010 and 2015."

Two specific questions will be addressed with an experiment: How does the timing of plant growth interact with goose arrival time to alter summer-long magnitudes of plant production, foliar chemistry, and availability; and, How does the timing of plant growth interact with goose arrival time to alter summer-long magnitudes of net ecosystem CO2 exchange, gross ecosystem photosynthesis, and ecosystem respiration?"

This project is addressing the environmental, social and economic aspects of urban coastal sustainability and is producing insights that could transform assessments and management of coastal sustainability across the globe.  The research will resolve key uncertainties about nitrogen dynamics in a vitally important, increasingly common and dynamic land use type in the coastal zone, and directly address the human social and economic factors that underlie the capacity for improving these dynamics:  How efficient are stream restoration and installation of green infrastructure in reducing nitrogen delivery to the coast?  Are these effects easily overwhelmed by degradation of fundamental sanitary infrastructure?  Do coastal residents of different socio-economic status and distance to the coast really know and care about the ecological integrity of receiving waters?  Can their knowledge and interest be increased with citizen science efforts?  Answers to these questions will point the way forward for cities to address a key component of coastal sustainability on a sounder biophysical, social and economic footing."

Interestingly, though, one of the best ways to look for noise, and differentiate between different sources of noise, is still the human eye.  Therefore, in this project, we ask for help from citizen scientists, who will have the opportunity to learn to characterize and classify potentially new sources of noise in the LIGO system; working in concert with machine-learning algorithms to amplify the work of the citizen scientists, this project helps scientists narrow their focus to gravitational wave sources and develop citizen science methods that can scale with upcoming data-intensive scientific endeavors."

        "This project lays the foundations for the analysis and design of peer production systems consisting of socially interacting volunteers and machines that jointly perform distributed tasks. The envisioned implementation targets the unique scientific and societal domain offered by cyber-enabled citizen science environmental control in the highly polluted Gowanus Canal in Brooklyn. The proposed  Brooklyn Atlantis  citizen science system consists of an array of mobile instrumented buoys for water monitoring with wireless capabilities, controlled by volunteers using a web-based peer-production system. Through the integration of dynamical systems theory, marine robotics, and technology-mediated social participation, the project will develop: 1) a model for complex systems comprising networks of humans and machines with a focus on technology-mediated social participation systems; 2) design guidelines for peer production systems to enhance participation in citizen science projects; and 3) a cyber-human infrastructure for real time monitoring and hazard detection of the natural environment combining mobile robotic sensor networks and human operated control systems. The broader impacts of this project include: 1) establishing a technology-based avenue for enhancing local community citizenry and engagement; 2) developing citizen based environmental monitoring platforms that could provide life-saving advantages; 3) leveraging interactive robotics, environmental awareness, and citizen science to foster interest and engagement in STEM fields among the general public and K-12 students; 4) fostering multidisciplinary thinking among NYU-Poly students; 5) promoting the awareness of citizen science capabilities among researchers; and 6) integrating research components in outreach programs. This project has the potential of transforming the field of dynamical systems through the integration of collective human intelligence in the design and adaption of engineered architectures. Similarly, it may transform thinking on social peer production systems to incorporate real-time mobile interactive machines and task co-execution."

Some endeavors may even start from information not being available and accessible in digital form, and when it is available, it is often in non-structured form, not compatible with analytics tools that require structured and uniformly-formatted data. Two main methods to deal with the volume and variety of data as well as to accelerate the rate of digitization have been to apply crowdsourcing or machine-learning solutions. However, very little has been done to simultaneously take advantage of both types of solutions, and to make it easier for different efforts to share and reuse developed software elements. The vision of the Human- and Machine-Intelligent Network (HuMaIN) project is to accelerate scientific data digitization through fundamental advances in the integration and mutual cooperation between human and machine processing in order to handle practical hurdles and bottlenecks present in scientific data digitization. Even though HuMaIN concentrates on digitization tasks faced by the biodiversity community, the software elements being developed are generic in nature, and expected to be applicable to other scientific domains (e.g., exploring the surface of the moon for craters require the same type of crowdsourcing tool as finding words in text, and the same questions of whether machine-learning tools could provide similar results can be tested). The HuMaIN project proposes to conduct research and develop the following software elements: (a) configurable Machine-Learning applications for scientific data digitization (e.g., Optical Character Recognition and Natural Language Processing), which will be made automatically available as RESTful services for increasing the ability of HuMaIN software elements to interoperate with other elements while decreasing the software development time via a new application specification language; (b) workflows leading to a cyber-human coordination system that will take advantage of feedback loops (e.g., based on consensus of crowdsourced data and its quality) for self-adaptation to changes and increased sustainability of the overall system, (c) new crowdsourcing micro-tasks with ability of being reusable for a variety of scenarios and containing user activity sensors for studying time-effective user interfaces, and (d) services to support automated creation and configuration of crowdsourcing workflows on demand to fit the needs of individual groups. A cloud-based system will be deployed to provide the necessary execution environment with traceability of service executions involved in cyber-human workflows, and cost-effectiveness analysis of all the software elements developed in this project will provide assessment and evaluation of long standing what-if scenarios pertaining human- and machine-intelligent tasks. Crowdsourcing activities will attract a wide range of users with tasks that require low expertise, and at the same time it will expose volunteers to applied science and engineering, potentially attracting interest of K-12 teachers and students."

        "Since the Spring of 2011, we have deployed an Android application called WiEye, which is currently in use by over 10k ongoing users and has collected over 250 million measurements. There are multiple stages of the project that will be ongoing that will leverage this WiEye database for crowdsourcing research: 1. Step 1: We must first finalize our understanding of how a mobile phone approach the fidelity of more advanced, costly instrumentation specifically designed to measure wireless behavior in terms of course metrics such as signal strength and spectral activity. 2. Step 2: From there, channel modeling to the degree that primary (e.g., line-of-sight) paths or secondary (e.g., multiple non-direct) paths are understood for diverse types of environments and/or geographical factors must then be studied. For example, we will characterize a mountainous region (versus the flat DFW area) as I will teach a course at SMU in Taos this summer called Mobile Phone Embedded Design (EE 5378/7378), where spectral activity, wireless propagation, and structural health of unique infrastructure will be measured in the Taos region. 3. Step 3: More generally, we then will investigate what role does geographical information (such as LIDAR data) has on the performance of wireless networks by isolating each effect (e.g., tree canopy height and width, land use, amount of free space, and building height and area). The detailed understanding obtained here will help tremendously for the spatial dimensions that are emerging as problematic for such applications as dynamic spectrum access. 4. Step 4: Finally, we will focus on our works impact on the standardization efforts (e.g., License Assisted Access), dynamic spectrum access, and broader-reaching applications for the crowdsourced based understanding of wireless environments including continue to pursue commercialization that is a result of NSF I-Corps as well as the multi- disciplinary objectives discussed above."

        "The naming and classifying of living organisms is a fundamental principal upon which biology is founded. Indeed, almost every facet of our lives - from the food we eat to the medicine we take, the houses we live in to the natural scenery we admire - has a connection to the biodiversity present on Earth. All species must be named and cataloged in order for humans to understand the world around us. The scientific field of taxonomy, responsible for identifying and describing species, has incurred a reduction in its specialist workforce in recent decades; this is unfortunate because the need for taxonomy has never been greater as human activities result in unprecedented decline in the diversity of life. This project will help to reduce the burden placed on current and future taxonomists to identify and catalog biodiversity by introducing a set of open-source, web-based tools for identifying species from images and for measuring imaged specimens for comparative studies. These software tools will be made freely available through the publicly-funded CyVerse web platform. In addition, a system for identifying dragonflies and damselflies called ODOMATIC will be implemented on an existing web presence, OdonataCentral, allowing researchers and enthusiasts to accurately identify these insects from images of their wings. A series of free workshops will be offered in diverse urban communities in New Jersey and Alabama to increase the diversity of OdonataCentral?s user base, encourage participation in the STEM fields, and generally increase appreciation and understanding of the natural world. A series of Google Hangout events will encourage international user-ship for ODOMATIC from World Dragonfly Association members in Latin America, Africa, and Asia. In addition, undergraduate students from Rutgers University-Newark will be recruited to help in designing and training ODOMATIC, giving them valuable experience in research, programming and taxonomy. This work will help to reduce the taxonomic impediment - an urgent need for more taxonomic products, like species descriptions and specimen identifications, from fewer taxonomist workers - by addressing the time-consuming, but necessary, task that is species identification. Objectives of this project include release of a newly-developed system for automatically identifying Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies) from images of their wings, which uses computer vision and machine learning to characterize and classify species. An interface will be deployed making species identification using this system accessible through the OdonataCentral website (odonatacentral.org). In addition, stand-alone tools will be developed for automatically describing and placing geometric morphometric landmarks on specimens in biological imagery for use in morphology-based comparative studies. The successful completion of these objectives will benefit the odonatological community by providing dragonfly and damselfly identification. More broadly, the tools created here will allow biologists studying other groups of organisms to rapidly extract morphological data from images of their specimens."

        "This Frontier award supports the SONYC project, a smart cities initiative focused on developing a cyber-physical system (CPS) for the monitoring, analysis and mitigation of urban noise pollution. Noise pollution is one of the topmost quality of life issues for urban residents in the U.S. with proven effects on health, Education, the economy, and the environment. Yet, most cities lack the resources for continuously monitoring noise and understanding the contribution of individual sources, the tools to analyze patterns of noise pollution at city-scale, and the means to empower city agencies to take effective, data-driven action for noise mitigation. The SONYC project advances novel technological and socio-technical solutions that help address these needs. SONYC includes a distributed network of both sensors and people for large-scale noise monitoring. The sensors use low-cost, low-power technology, and cutting-edge machine listening techniques, to produce calibrated acoustic measurements and recognizing individual sound sources in real time. Citizen science methods are used to help urban residents connect to city agencies and each other, understand their noise footprint, and facilitate reporting and self-regulation. Crucially, SONYC utilizes big data solutions to analyze, retrieve and visualize information from sensors and citizens, creating a comprehensive acoustic model of the city that can be used to identify significant patterns of noise pollution. This data can in turn be used to drive the strategic application of noise code enforcement by city agencies, in a way that optimally reduces noise pollution. The entire system, integrating cyber, physical and social infrastructure, forms a closed loop of continuous sensing, analysis and actuation on the environment.  SONYC is an interdisciplinary collaboration between researchers at New York University and Ohio State University. It provides multiple educational opportunities to students at all levels, including an outreach initiative for K-12 STEM education. The project uses New York City as its focal point, involving partnerships with the city's Department of Environmental Protection, Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, the business improvement district of Lower Manhattan, and ARUP, one of the world's leaders in environmental acoustics. SONYC is an innovative and high-impact application of cyber-physical systems to the realm of smart cities, and potentially a catalyst for new CPS research at the intersection of engineering, data science and the social sciences. It provides a blueprint for the mitigation of noise pollution that can be applied to cities in the US and abroad, potentially affecting the quality of life of millions of people."

        "Introduction This project lays the foundations for a causal analysis of lay/expert collaborative research or citizen science. While the potential of such collaborations to advance knowledge and societal well-being are well known, little is known about what makes them succeed or fail. The PIs propose to bridge this gap by adopting a new approach that goes beyond traditional observational studies. The PIs propose to use mixed methods and an innovative parallel-study design. They will demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach by examining the social conditions and processes that produce or forestall transformative, community-driven science in response to the current Gulf oil disaster. In addition, they plan to produce interdisciplinary and socially robust environmental knowledge about the impacts of the disaster by combining the expertise of environmental scientists, social scientists, and Vietnamese-Americans living and working in south Louisiana who bring their deep experiential knowledge of the region?s impacted ecosystems to the scientific work.  Intellectual Merits The proposed study is interdisciplinary. It is designed to advance basic social studies of science while simultaneously contributing to the production of socially robust environmental science. It s so in the form of two parallel analyses. The first is a community-driven toxicological study of wetlands contamination; the second is a sociological analysis of the initiation, development, and execution of that collaborative process. Both studies address substantively important problems. The community-driven study will investigate the exposure and impacts of petroleum hydrocarbons on finfish species that are culturally and economically important to Vietnamese-Americans whose livelihoods rely on commercial and subsistence fishing. Working together, residents and scientists will identify and prioritize target species and biological endpoints. The findings of the study will provide sound data that form the basis for hypothesis-driven future research on the long-term ecological impacts of the disaster. The sociological study will investigate the lay/expert collaboration for insight into the causal processes that generate successful citizen science.  Potential Broader Impacts  The interdisciplinary knowledge produced by this study will aid in scientific efforts to investigate the social and environmental impacts of the oil disaster by capturing time-sensitive social and ecological data that can be used by other natural and social scientists. The community-driven nature of the project and contributions to knowledge production by an underrepresented social group helps ensure that the scientific knowledge will be socially meaningful to Gulf Coast residents and local governments as well state and federal agencies working to mitigate disaster impacts. The project also holds significant educational opportunities. These include opportunities for interdisciplinary exchanges between social and natural scientists, and research training opportunities for undergraduate students and adult non-scientists. The project will also enhance institutional relationships between Tulane and Washington State Universities that bridge regional and public/private divides in the academy. Finally, the proposed study has strong potential to seed an effective and sustainable community-academic network for addressing ecological and environmental health issues in south Louisiana and elsewhere."

        "Backyard Bark Beetles is a citizen science initiative aimed at producing and maintaining a large-scale, long-term bark beetle monitoring program. Our trapping activity is easy, fun, effective, and utilizes items found in the everyday household (2L bottle, hand sanitizer, etc.). This activity can be completed by anyone, anywhere. It is especially useful as a hands-on activity to complement in-school lessons focused on topics like native/invasive species, forest health, environmental stewardship, etc. and has been used in courses spanning multiple disciplines (e.g., environmental science, entomology, ecology, etc.). Our website (www.backyardbarkbeetles.org) is easily accessible and contains all the information needed to participate (informational handouts, instructions, etc.). Also, teachers: a narrated lesson on bark & ambrosia beetles is available that can be modified for in-class use. Once we receive your beetles, they will be identified and promptly added to the interactive map, which can be found at bottom of the project's homepage (www.backyardbarkbeetles.org). On this map, you can view pictures and read information about the beetles you (and fellow citizen scientists!) have collected. Almost instant feedback! With this program, we can learn where populations have become established and track newly invasive species, all while engaging the public (i.e., citizen scientists) in real-world scientific research. Help us understand what kinds of bark beetles are in YOUR backyard! Additional information & participant feedback can be found on our Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/backyardbarkbeetles/) and Twitter (https://twitter.com/BackyardBeetles?lang=en) pages. Questions? Send them to lab@backyardbarkbeetles.org."

This open educational resource will be a powerful supplement to more-traditional identification keys used by volunteers. Many volunteer biomonitoring groups lack access to physical specimens and other high quality reference materials. Our tool features zoomable, high-resolution images for the 150 most commonly found taxa in the Eastern United States. Diagnostic characters for 50 selected taxa will have added multimedia annotations at the order, family, and genus level. These explorable images can be dynamically manipulated by the user to see and learn these important characters in context. Detailed descriptions of the diagnostic characters, life history, food preferences, ecological information, pollution tolerance values, and terminology supports will be provided to aid identification for each taxon. Using design-based learning research and evaluation approaches, we will examine expert and learner practices through cognitive task analysis methods, and explore affordances of an innovative online field guide and collection of high-resolution aquatic macroinvertebrates images to facilitate science learning and engagement in taxonomic identification activities. This research study will help guide engagement and build capacity with scientists, citizen scientists, and informal science education (ISE) professionals to utilize new media technologies to facilitate public-science interactions and catalyze participatory kinds of science learning and research experiences with public audiences."

        "This project will develop theory, algorithms, and example systems for motivating large numbers of autonomous individuals to solve problems that require coordination in the physical world. In these  physical crowdsourcing  systems, people make small contributions toward a larger collective problem, such as tracking animal species or air quality for citizen science projects or providing rides or package delivery in commercial applications. In these systems, opportunistically relying on people to do convenient parts of the problem causes incomplete solutions, while directing people to do inconvenient tasks requires high incentives. By modeling the timing and location of tasks, along with knowledge of people's routines, the project will develop algorithms that make use of ideas from decision theory to best decide when, where and to whom to suggest tasks, in a way that balances individual convenience with system needs. Doing this should increase people's willingness to participate, reduce the need to incentivize participation, and create more complete, timely, and accurate solutions to the collective problem. The investigators will develop several prototype systems that address practical problems such as package delivery and lost and found searches to demonstrate the effectiveness of their ideas; they will also release a toolkit that allows other people to use their work when designing their own physical crowdsourcing systems for solving both scientific and practical problems of interest to society.  The work will be carried out in three main phases. The first phase will develop  incentive chaining , a strategy to encourage opportunistic contributors to become more directable. Using an existing prototype for surveying tree species, the team will model people's opportunistic contributions and routines, then suggest relatively easy  nearby  tasks where others have contributed but where further work is needed, building people's interest and capacity to contribute. Once the nearby collaborative tasks are done, the system will direct these experienced and motivated contributors toward new areas and tasks, which will in turn become the  nearby  contributions that attract the next round of contributors. The second phase will develop decision-theoretic hit-or-wait algorithms to decide if and when to notify contributors about tasks, using a community-based lost and found application. Building on the modeling of behavioral routines, these algorithms will use sequential decision processes to estimate the maximize total value of tasks that contributors will complete, given individuals' history and current state, the system-determined value of nearby tasks, and the system's estimate of how likely the contributor would be to respond to a notification. The third phase will develop notification policies that satisfy the system's quality of service needs while minimizing disruption to contributors. To do this, the investigators will develop a supply management framework that considers the pool of available helpers, the current task demand and values, and a range of policies for making directed requests and evaluate it in the context of a peer-to-peer package delivery system."

The BioBlitz included bird walks, talks, activities, and demonstrations. We concentrated on four main areas: Birding: Learn about the world of birding in the remote Great Basin Bird Science: Learn about the science used in ornithology Bird Conservation: Learn how we apply bird science and bird observations to real-life issues Bird Photography: Take photos of birds in the park to serve as vouchers (definitive proof that they exist in the park). Over 80 species need to be vouchered."

        "The All Taxa Biodiversity Inventory (ATBI)/BioBlitz SWAT Teams are graduate students who survey gaps in biodiversity understanding on vital public and private lands, design field research that narrows those gaps and create media about their work that fosters public understanding and inspires better care of our planet. Research on biodiversity and the relationship between organisms is imperative to develop management practices for the conservation of protected areas. The E.O. Wilson Biodiversity Foundation, along with the National Park Service, Discover Life in America and Turner Endangered Species Fund, formed our team of four Duke University students as the first of many groups of students to travel to protected areas and develop approaches to conduct biodiversity research that can inform its conservation. Our team assessed the current status of biodiversity research at Rocky Mountain National Park to determine major gaps in the understanding of biodiversity. We used various data sources to find species lists from research conducted in the Park to ensure that the National Park Species Database was updated with the most recent information. Our team added 667 species to the database through this process. One of the identified gaps was a lack of research on spiders in the park. We piloted a field study on spider biodiversity to identify species existing in the park and to understand their ecological roles. Our resulting field study added 102 new spider species to the park database. We also conducted a mini-Bioblitz with adults and children in order to foster an interest in citizen science activities. Finally, we created a video to create awareness about our topic, foster curiosity, and spark interest in the area of science and biodiversity."

Participants share best practices, lessons learned, examples, links to resources and real world scientific data. Students and teachers engage in science education outdoors and explore scientific practices through real-world resource projects. By spending time in the field investigating and researching their section of the watershed, groups become intimately familiar with their outdoor classroom. The Pacific Northwest has only 3 native species of crayfish and at least 6 non-native species. It appears that there is only one native species in Washington. Data is lacking on crayfish, so you and your students can contribute critical data by collecting and sharing data about the crayfish in your area.

California Condors are one of the world\u2019s most endangered bird species with a population of only 22 condors in the early 1980s. Despite successful captive breeding and release efforts in recent years, the condor population remain heavily managed because they are frequently poisoned by lead from bullet fragments ingested in scavenged carcasses. Condor release sites, managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, National Park Service and Ventana Wildlife Society, offer uncontaminated carcasses to birds as a way to lure them back for medical care and regular management activities. These feeding stations are equipped with automatically triggered cameras that have captured photographs of condors. The Condor Watch project is using citizen science to help us tag these photos so that they can be analyzed."

The wayside content focuses on the impact climate change is and will have on the phenology of the park\u2019s iconic aquatic plant life, including its iconic water lilies and lotus, and other flora. Through these educational materials, park visitors are invited to observe the seasonal variations that occur in the park. Visitors are also challenged to observe how the practices used to manage the park\u2019s gardens have had to change to adapt these seasonal variations. The wayside will help to convey that this natural and historical-cultural landscape persists due to chief gardeners' ability to maintain the lilies through the seasons, despite susceptibility to many climate change impacts. ...

To tell Rock Creek\u2019s climate story, the interns\u2019 work focused on the wood thrush, the official bird of Washington, D.C. Interns researched why Rock Creek is an ideal habitat for the wood thrush by exploring the bird\u2019s migratory patterns, preferred food sources, and habitat choice. ... The design of the wayside creates a connection between visitors and the park by giving a view of the landscape as it would be seen by the wood thrush. One aspect of this story is the parallel between the wood thrush\u2019s annual migration to Nicaragua and the growing community of Latin American immigrants near Rock Creek National Park. ...Other components include citizen science opportunities at the park and links to other resources, such as the Cornell Lab of Ornithology and the Smithsonian Migratory Bird Center.  http://esp.gmu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ESP_Newsletter_Fall_2013.pdf"

In the midst of underfunded state volunteer monitoring programs, the Secchi Dip-In has served as a place for volunteers to continue submitting their data. In 2015, Dr. Robert Carlson transferred the operation of the Secchi Dip-In to the North American Lake Management Society and over the past 20 years, the database accumulated more than 41,000 records on more than 7,000 individual waterbodies."

        "Summer on the Marsh followed from our successful Summer Science project by establishing a regional network of eight summer camp programs grounded in field experiences for environmental education in the marsh ecosystem. The two-year program included citizen science monitoring by campers ages 9-12, support and training for informal science center staff and partner scientists, and dissemination to peers at regional and national forums. Collaboration throughout the project enabled partner organizations to share activities and knowledge in both informal education and the significance of marsh ecosystems. The project served 45 staff (educators and scientists) and 547 youth over two years across New England. The project funding ended in December 2015, but we have made our data, protocol and data sheets available on CitSci.org. We know some of our original camps will continue to collect data, and hope we can inspire others to adopt it as well.  The project was successful in supporting environmental stewardship in all involved. Educators and scientists benefited from working together closely. We found that a strong connection between the scientist and educators increased enthusiasm which was then expressed at camp. Our two day training\u2019s at the beginning of each year helped with this connection. The campers came in describing salt marshes as smelly, muddy places and left the program describing marshes as barriers, food sources, and filters. The campers changed their view from self-focused to an ecosystem focus. This awareness of marsh functions will likely lead to increased environmental stewardship. In fact, parent surveys in the Fall following camp reported that the majority of campers had taken actions to protect the environment."

The resulting volcanic smog (vog), a mixture of SO2 and fine particulate matter (PM), can have negative impacts on human health as well as agriculture, and consequently is a major concern of local communities. Because of the high variability of the volcanic plume, community members exposures to vog cannot be easily estimated. The region thus serves as a unique test case for the use and assessment of distributed air quality (AQ) networks based on portable low-cost sensors. This project entails the development and deployment of a state-of-the-art community-based AQ sensor network across Hawaii Island (HI-Vog), for the measurement of SO2 and PM levels with high spatial and temporal resolution. The network aims to provide improved measurements of air quality and vog exposures across the island, as well as to assess the utility of AQ sensor networks as community resources and as tools for atmospheric chemistry research."

        " At each workshop, EPA and the California SWRCB  demonstrated the utility of the app to local watershed managers, citizen scientists, environmental justice organizations and tribal members. In addition to classroom training, participants performed hands-on training. The Marine Sanitary Survey App was developed by the U.S. EPA and is based on the marine beach sanitary survey form. This app provides a technically sound and consistent approach to identify pollution sources and share information (e.g., water quality data, pollutant source data, and land use data) to improve water quality for swimming and other primary contact recreation activities.\n"

Multiple analysts increase the precision of the analysis and reduces bias but is more expensive if done by trained professional analysts.

Since launch, over 3,500 volunteer citizen scientists have made approximately 430,000 classifications across nearly 60,000 underwater images during the 2019 Bottomfish Fishery-Independent Survey in Hawaii (BFISH). After logging into the OceanEYEs website, volunteers are guided through a short tutorial where they learn about the Bottomfish stock, stock assessment science, as well as the fish species being surveyed.  They are taught how to recognize each of the key species and are then presented with underwater images from the survey.  They are first asked if they see any fish in the image and, if so, are asked to mark the location of the fish and identify the species by name. Initial results suggest that the information provided by multiple Citizen Scientists can, when combined, rival that provided by professional annotators. The work being done by OceanEYEs volunteers can allow NOAA scientists to look at new ways of counting fish and is being used to develop artificial intelligence solutions, training computers to identify fish and allowing NOAA scientists to deploy human expertise more efficiently. To-date, the work done by OceanEYEs citizen scientists is equivalent to just over one hundred FTE hours."

These data can be used for multiple purposes, such as archiving where flowing water is present in forest planning units, informing modeling efforts of streamflow permanence, and providing information needed to update stream classifications across any spatial extent. FLOwPER uses the ArcGIS Online (AGOL) Survey123 platform, which operates on a variety of mobile devices, including those from agencies and personal mobile devices. FLOwPER is designed for seamless communication with ArcGIS online for easy uploading of collected observations into a publicly available master database (FLOwPER Database) that can include any geographic region. FLOwPER focuses on the rapid collection of a set of simple visual observations that can be recorded from a road over a stream or while standing on the bank of a stream. Use of FLOwPER requires a mobile device that can access the FLOwPER field form through the Survey123 app and an accurate Global Positioning System (GPS) antenna with a rated accuracy of 1 meter or less. With crowdsourced observations collected by many users of FLOwPER, it is possible to collect a large number of observations from a wide geographical range from all parts of the stream network at any time of the year. Although seasonal drying of streams is often of interest, FLOwPER can be used to evaluate patterns of flow permanence at any time of year, including times when stream networks are greatly expanded during wet cycles."

A multidisciplinary community arose from that collaboration and identified aspirational cancer challenges that require shared efforts across cancer research, artificial intelligence, and advanced computing technologies. Digital twin technology is one of those challenges. In July 2020, 30 multidisciplinary scientists participated in a five-day interactive event, the NCI-DOE Collaboration Virtual Ideas Lab: Toward Building a Cancer Patient 'Digital Twin'. They formed new collaborations and created innovative research projects focusing on a digital twin component that, within the next 2-3 years, will advance the development of a model of an individual cancer patient. Six multidisciplinary mentors from government, academia, and industry advised the project teams. Over 130 scientists applied. Participants were selected to create a balance of diverse expertise, career-level and demographics. A digital twin is a computer replica of the systems and processes needed to run simulations without disrupting or harming the real-world object. A digital twin would be a real-life replica of the human body able to show outcomes in the present and future. A cancer patient's digital twin (aka, avatar or virtual patient) could be used as a holistic computer-based model to enable personalized medicine, support  cancer research, pre-clinical development, clinical trials, aid diagnosis and support running treatment simulations. The research projects have the potential to lead to disease- and intervention-specific models and simulations, using mathematical, active learning and ensemble model approaches."

Extirpation of pika populations has been linked to climate change in the Great Basin, Southern Utah and California. The species may be more resilient to climate change in high-elevation habitat in Colorado. However, recent research predicts that pikas may be extirpated from Rocky Mountain National Park (RMNP) by 2100 under some climate change scenarios. There is a pressing need to assess the species' vulnerability to climate change across Colorado. The White River National Forest (WRNF) and the Front Range Pika Project (FRPP) are engaging citizen scientists in field surveys to determine the status of pika populations as an indicator of alpine ecosystem integrity.

The project is streamlining the NFAL hydrology and aquatic ecology programs by providing a water quality monitoring workflow and data collection that supports both programs. To accomplish the project's goal, NFAL established a partnership with the Alabama Water Watch (AWW) program, a statewide volunteer water monitoring program that is based at the Auburn University Water Resources Center and is also supported by the Alabama Cooperative Extension System. AWW led recruitment and training of citizen scientists who were certified to conduct water chemistry and bacteriological water tests according to AWW's EPA-approved Quality Assurance Plans. Following certification, volunteer monitors chose strategically selected sampling sites from the priority watershed on each forest. The project provides volunteers with access to monitoring materials required for data collection. Monitors submit their water data on a monthly basis to the AWW Database through AWW's online data portal. In turn, the data is made public through the AWW Water Data Tools on the AWW webpage and is provided to NFAL for further analysis. Because of their engagement in the project as citizen scientists, participants now have an increased sense of appreciation of the NFAL. Furthermore, they are helping to establish a baseline of water quality observations within the priority watersheds on the NFAL that will be used to evaluate how management practices are resulting in clean water for the Forests, its ecosystems, and the public and to develop a Watershed Restoration Action Plan (WRAP) to make better land management decisions within each forest."

Obtaining distribution and population-status information can be labor intensive (e.g., electrofishing, redd counts) and distinguishing adult Brook Lamprey and Pacific Lamprey ammocetes requires specialized expertise. These constraints, paired with a lack of prior management interest in lamprey population status has meant that lamprey data collection is often ancillary to other studies (e.g., salmonids). Environmental DNA (eDNA) is one technique that can help us obtain species specific lamprey data to aid in the development of accurate fish distribution maps. Environmental DNA techniques also lend themselves to the use of volunteer networks to collect the necessary samples, since volunteers do not need to be experts in identification of juvenile lamprey. This project is developing a network of citizen scientists and testing several techniques for obtaining eDNA samples in targeted areas within the Coos watershed."

This project addressed this informational need by developing a citizen science program to collect location information of traditionally used plants. The project is therefore 1) enabling 4FRI managers to develop management protocols to ensure long-term sustainability and availability of these resources for tribes, 2) enhancing tribal access to traditionally-used plants, and 3) providing data to researchers to devise scientifically-based management and restoration protocols for these species.

It will also target the topic of fostering and sustaining public engagement - lack of which is frequently cited as a leading cause of project failure."

Track the number of participants who are inspired to become involved beyond the Cache Creek Study, thus increasing citizen knowledge and appreciation of nature throughout Teton County. (2) Achieve a sufficient number of total monitoring observations and total number of field days within the Cache Creek recreation area to paint an accurate picture about existing conditions and establish a baseline for trends. Meet established monitoring requirements for the area through the use of innovative technology to inform decisions that eventually achieve desired conditions. Desired conditions are aimed at this area serving as a model for integrating recreation and conservation \u2013 promoting community stewardship, healthy lifestyles, sustainable recreation, and connection with nature. (3) Improve the public dissemination of monitoring observations to illustrate how conditions are changing in Cache Creek and how the Cache Creek study area contributes to larger Nature Mapping Jackson Hole observations and climate data being collected throughout Teton County. This will be assessed by recording the number of people attending presentations, local media coverage, and social media/website hits.",

The available equipment includes instruments for measuring water quality parameters (YSI multimeter sondes), pathogen monitoring (IDEXX testing for bacteria: Enterococcus, fecal coliform, total coliform and E. Coli), and microplastic collection (manta trawl \u2013 boat required) along with handheld GPS units and turbidity tubes. Organizations that participate receive hands-on training from EPA regional staff. All recipients must submit a Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) before receiving their equipment, provide monthly updates, and submit a final report that summarizes the work and outcomes of the data collection. This program is open to participatory scientist organizations in New York, New Jersey, Puerto Rico, US Virgin Islands and nine Tribal Nations. Priority is given to sites within communities with environmental justice issues and new applicants. The program runs annually in New York and New Jersey to reflect the general sampling season (May-November). Beginning in 2018, to accommodate more communities, the program began working with the Caribbean Science Consortium to set up a formal system of Equipment Loan Centers with university partners throughout Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. There are currently seven centers in Puerto Rico and two in the US Virgin Islands, each with their own full set of equipment maintained by university staff. This project requests applications annually in February/March for NY and NJ and on a rolling basis in Puerto Rico and the USVI."

This approach can supplement the current methods, i.e., deployment of hydrological measurement equipment (stream gauges), that is costly and requires specialized expertise. This user-friendly alternative relies on continuous photo imagery and machine learning to estimate streamflow. Water volume is a critical variable in maintaining both the health of aquatic and riparian biological communities and for human uses of water. However, in many parts of the country, flow regimes are changing due to anthropogenic changes and natural impacts. Today, the USGS maintains over 7,000 continuous water monitoring gages, but most are in large rivers and reduced funding has led to removal of gages. Therefore, many states, tribes, and other groups want to collect more hydrologic data, especially in small to mid-size streams. In this proof of concept project, the website 'Flow Pictures Explorer' is being expanded as a publicly available repository for photos and hydrographs. State and tribal partners are supplying thousands of continuous photos from game cameras together with hydrological data for multiple stream sites. By using continuous imagery of streams with novel machine learning, states, tribes, nonprofits/watershed associations, and other groups will gain a better understanding of altered hydrology. "

Have you ever wondered what it would be like to lie down in your astronaut suit on the surface of Mars and look up at clouds in the Martian sky? While no humans have done so yet, we know that clouds are a regular phenomenon in Mars's atmosphere. With the help of telescopes, orbiters, and our rovers' eyes, we've been able to spot them for some time. Clouds are an important area of research on Mars (and on Earth, too) because of their feedback on the climate -- they can reflect incoming sunlight which has a cooling effect and absorb the planet's outgoing infrared radiation which has a warming effect. In fact, clouds may have played a crucial role in sustaining a warm atmosphere on early Mars enabling liquid water to flow and carve out channels we see in the geology today. Whereas Earth clouds are made of liquid water, the cold temperatures and low pressures of Mars today (which prevent liquid water) allow water-ice and carbon-dioxide ice clouds to form. The Mars Climate Sounder, an instrument on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, is able to see clouds at very high altitudes (>30 miles) in the Martian atmosphere and our goal is to map them to better understand their composition and how they form. But we need your help!"
